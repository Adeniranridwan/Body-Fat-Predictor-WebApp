# Body-Fat-Predictor-WebApp
The accurate prediction of body fat is important for assessing obesity and its related diseases
the results was positively influeced by the following which helps to reduce the rmse and increase the r2 scores.
variable tranformation
feature selection

Obesity, characterized by excessive body fat, is a major public health concern that can lead to serious health issues. Despite the availability of various methods to measure body fat, they often require expensive equipment and tests. Hence, the ability to accurately estimate body fat percentage using readily accessible measurements is crucial in evaluating obesity and its associated diseases. The choice of body measurement features (e.g. waist circumference) is also important.

Road-Traffic-Severity-Classification-Project
This is a regression project to predict the body fat percentage. The project is based on athropological data real-world data and dataset is also highly. Learn more about detailed description and problem with tasks performed.

Description: This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city, Ethiopia police departments for master's research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms.

Problem Statement: The target feature is Accident_severity which is a multi-class variable. The task is to classify this variable based on the other 31 features step-by-step by going through each day's task. Your metric for evaluation will be f1-score.

feature selection



3. Modelling using sci-kit learn library

Baseline model using linear regression and random forest using default techniques
Tuned hyperparameters using n_estimators and max_depth parameters
4. Evaluation

Evaluation metric was weighted rmse and r2score.
Baseline model evaluation fl_score = 61%
Final model evaluation r2_score = 67%
