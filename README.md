Tasks and techniques used:

2. Data preparation and pre-processing
variable tansformation using log
feature selection



3. Modelling using sci-kit learn library

Baseline model using linear regression and random forest using default techniques
Tuned hyperparameters using n_estimators and max_depth parameters
4. Evaluation

Evaluation metric was weighted rmse and r2score.

Final model evaluation r2_score = 67%
