Obesity, characterized by excessive body fat, is a major public health concern that can lead to serious health issues. Despite the availability of various methods to measure body fat, they often require expensive equipment and tests. Hence, the ability to accurately estimate body fat percentage using readily accessible measurements is crucial in evaluating obesity and its associated diseases. The choice of body measurement features (e.g. waist circumference) is also important.
